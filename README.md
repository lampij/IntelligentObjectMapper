# Intelligent Object Mapping

Inspired by Microsoft PROSE, the idea behind this research is to see if, given two models of data;
    - Input model
    - Destination model

Where Input model is an object representation of some data we have, and Destination model is the storage point we would like to fill the rest of our model out from.

Can we pull the correct data, for the given 'example data' in the Input model from the destination model?
